# johans-jetpack-navigation

Simple project to experiment and understand jetpack navigation. 

3 fragments, A, B and C.
Navigation is like this: A => B => C => A => ... for ever.

Go back in commits to find more simple example than master.

For example the state after the commit "backstack always zero at A fragment, as we wish" makes backstack never pile on and on.
